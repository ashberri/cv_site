    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <!--<p>Nothing <span style="color:#E0218A;">yet</span></p> -->
    <p>hello! I grew up in Shenzhen, China. My family moved to California when I was in high school. We now live in Victoria, BC. Between my 2nd and 3rd year of undergrad, I spent a year in the Middle East studying and working at the University of Jordan in 2023-2024. 
<!--    <br><br> I am a little autistic:) At this point, it has become a positive and unique element of my personality and intellectual persuits, mainly manifesting as a love for literature and all kinds of sciences.-->
<!--    <br><br> In my spare time I enjoy making coffee, reading magazines, listening to podcast, inventing Middle Eastern and Asian inspired dishes, and writing literary reviews with friends.-->
    <!--<br><br> My dreamhome will have a wide window seat with cozy curtains, a practice room, a vibrantly colored family space, and a private doorway connecting my study to the garden.-->
    <br><br> My passion for political science started like this: Before taking our family to the states, my father liked to say: "this [China] is not the political system that will allow you to choose what you want." I was unconvinced: "then what kind of system does, and how does it and I myself know what I want?" As a Physics major, he didn't know. So, I began reading Plato.
    <br><br> If you are browsing this page, I probably really look forward to learning from and working with you!
