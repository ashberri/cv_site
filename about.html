    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Before sending me to America, my father liked to tell me: "This (China) is not the kind of political system that will allow you to choose what you want for a good life." I was unconvinced: "What kind of political system does,  how does it know what is good, and how will I know what I want?" My father responded: "Just, go there."</p>
    <p> In my seventh year living in the states, I am still figuring it out. I began college intrigued by political theories, aspired to be a part time essayist, and lived in Jordan during my gap year working, studying, and living with different communities in search of an answer.</p>
    <p> Today, I am a computational social scientist determined to combine innovative methods and empirical theories to answer these philosophical questions. It is fascinating to think about how nonpolitical messages interact with individual characteristics via social media algorithm to shape the person's political beliefs and in turns the governance of a country. Moreover, the rich empirical foundations in American Politics, the diverse perspectives from Political Communication and Comparative Politics scholars, and the creativity from computationists in approaching this multi-step question deeply excite me.</p>
    <p> Simultaneously enjoying rigor, uncertainty, tangibility and imagination, I find the most joy and self potential in the empirical study of public opinion, theoretical exploration of deliberation and democracy, and methodological venture in machine learning. </p>
    <p> As a person, I love Shostakovich, cats and dogs, Walter Benjamin, Yasunari Kawabata, Hermann Hesse, Woody Allen, oatmilk chai latte, brussels sprouts, Eric Rohmer, and Green Day. I play tennis and roller skate, but on most days I stay home and work. When in a good mood I sit in the library, secretely playing Marilyn Manson at the max volume.</p>
