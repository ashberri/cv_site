    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Before sending me to America, my dad liked to say: "This (China) is not the kind of political system that will allow you to choose what you want for a good life." I was unconvinced: "What kind of political system does,  how will it and I know what is good?" A quantum physics major, my dad, didn't care: "Well, just, go."</p>
    <p> In my seventh year living in the states, I am still figuring it out. I began college intrigued by political theories, aspired to be an essayist like Walter Benjamin, absorbed by the studies of revolutions and authoritarian political communication, and lived in Jordan during a gap year working, writing, and living with different communities in search of an answer. Something felt missing: my studies were too abstract, too loose empirically, or too trivial and case specific.</p>
    <p> By chance I ran into a literary paper using text analysis to compare the sensual length of "one day" from the nineteenth century to now--which has increased from an average of six pages to 34 pages. That was a moment of not so much theoretical inspiration but psychological motivation: how to do something cool like that within the political science tradition?</p>
    <p> Today, I am a computational social scientist determined to combine innovative methods and empirical theories to answer these philosophical questions. It is fascinating to think about how nonpolitical messages interact with individual characteristics via social media algorithm to shape the person's political beliefs and in turns the governance of a country. Moreover, the rich empirical foundations in American Politics, the diverse perspectives from Political Communication and Comparative Politics scholars, and the creativity from computationists in approaching this multi-step question deeply excite me.</p>
    <p> I am excited to join a PhD program in political science that supports but scrutinizes my creativity and realizes my aspiration to be a scholar deeply engaged in the American Politics literature with its vigorous minds. Rigorous training in the literature, inferences, and building relationships will be of enourmous value to bold ventures.</p>
    <p> As a person, I love Shostakovich, cats and dogs, Hermann Hesse, Woody Allen, Yasunari Kawabata, brussels sprouts, Eric Rohmer, and Green Day. I roller skate and play tennis, but on most days I stay home, read and code. On an ordinary weekday, you would find me walking with lightly iced Americano or quietly studying in the library while playing in my earphones Marilyn Manson at the maximum volume.</p>
