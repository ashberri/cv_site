    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Before sending me to America, my father liked to tell me: "This (China) is not the kind of political system that will allow you to choose what you want for a good life." I was unconvinced: "What kind of political system does,  how does it know what is good, and how will I know what I want?" My father responded: "Just, go there."</p>
    <p> In my seventh year living in the states, I am still figuring it out. I began college intrigued by political theories, aspired to be a part time essayist, and lived in Jordan during my gap year working, studying, and living with different communities in search of an answer.</p>
    <p> Today, I am a computational social scientist determined to combine innovative methods and empirical theories to answer these philosophical questions. It is fascinating to think about how nonpolitical messages interact with individual characteristics via social media algorithm to shape the person's political beliefs and in turns the governance of a country. As philosophical as it can get, the rich empirical appraoches to this multi-step question and the methodological possibilities deeply excite me.</p>
    <p> As someone who simultaneously enjoys rigor, uncertainty, tangibility and imagination, I find the most joy and self potential in the empirical study of public opinion, theoretical exploration of deliberation and democracy, and methodological venture in machine learning. </p>
    <p> As a human being, I love Shostakovich, cats and dogs, Walter Benjamin, Hermann Hesse, Woody Allen, oatmilk chai latte, brussels sprouts, Eric Rohmer, Green Day, and Marilyn Manson. I play tennis and roller skate, but on most days I stay home and work.</p>
